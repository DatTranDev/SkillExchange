# Skill Exchange

**Skill Exchange** is an app designed to connect users for skill exchange. Users can register, choose skills they want to exchange, and join a learning community. The app uses a Tinder-like matching mechanism, where users swipe right to accept and left to deny, creating meeting rooms for skill exchanges and mutual evaluations.

## Key Features

### Login / Logout
- Users can register and log in to the system.
- During registration, users need to select a skill topic, describe their skill, provide portfolio information (where they studied or worked), and can add other skills of interest.
- Add certificate images and an avatar to complete the profile.
- Each user starts with an **elo rank of 0**.

### Matching System
- The matching mechanism works like Tinder:
  - **Swipe right** to **accept**.
  - **Swipe left** to **deny**.
- When two users match, a request is sent, and they wait for the partnerâ€™s acceptance.

### Meeting Room Creation
- When two users match successfully, a meeting room is created for them to exchange skills.
- Core features in the meeting room:
  - **Chat** in real-time.
  - **Evaluate the skill** of the partner (elo increases for the evaluated person and the evaluator, but the evaluator gets a smaller elo increase).
  - **Cancel the meeting room** if they no longer wish to continue.

### Upgrade Features
- **Rank avatar upgrade** based on the user's elo score (similar to a game rank system).
- **Expand functionality for high-ranked users**:
  - Users with higher elo can open meeting rooms for more participants.
  - Normal users can also join those larger meeting rooms.
